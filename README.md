## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Changing the type of added barcode, because some shops use other format than the one used now in my app. Maybe choosing a specific store from the list and then the code would be created with a specified format.

To do:
- Add notifications while new product is added to the list by another user
- Tests
